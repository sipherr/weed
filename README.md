# The Autoflower Bible
This is my grow journal to remind me of mistakes Ive made.Documenting the average lifecycle of autoflowering cannabis plants.


# Grow Room

4x4 Vivosun tent
4 inch exhaust



# Germination 

Use warm mist humidifier and big 12" oscillating fan for first 3 weeks. Remove the fan from the room and replace the warm mist humidifier with ultra sonic.

# Ventilation

Air circulation is good. Too much fan is not.
